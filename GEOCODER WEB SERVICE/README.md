Geocoding Flask Application
This project is a Flask web application that processes CSV files containing addresses. It uses the Geopy library to convert addresses into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) and allows users to download the processed file.

Features
Address Geocoding: Converts addresses from a CSV file into geographic coordinates using the Nominatim geocoding service.
File Upload: Users can upload CSV files containing addresses.
File Download: Users can download the processed file with added geographic coordinates.
Error Handling: Displays error messages if the file cannot be processed.
Requirements
Python 3.x
Flask
Geopy
Pandas
An internet connection for geocoding
Setup
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
cd your-repo

Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Required Python Packages:

pip install Flask Geopy pandas

Run the Flask Application:

python app.py

The application will be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Usage
Access the Home Page:

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ to reach the upload form.
Upload a CSV File:

Select and upload a CSV file containing an "Address" column.
The file should have at least one column labeled "Address".
Process the File:

The application will process the file, convert addresses to geographic coordinates, and generate a new CSV file.
Download the Processed File:

After processing, you will be redirected to a download page where you can download the processed file with coordinates.
Error Handling:

If the file cannot be processed (e.g., missing "Address" column or invalid file format), an error message will be displayed.
Project Structure
app.py: The main Flask application script.

index(): Renders the home page with the file upload form.
success_table(): Handles file uploads, processes the CSV, performs geocoding, and generates the processed file.
download(): Allows users to download the processed file.
templates/: Contains HTML templates used by Flask to render web pages.

index.html: The main form page where users upload their CSV files.
download.html: Provides a link for users to download the processed file.
Known Issues
Ensure that the uploaded file has an "Address" column; otherwise, the application will return an error message.
The application uses Nominatim's free API, which has usage limits. For extensive usage, consider setting up your own Nominatim server or using a paid geocoding service.
