Project Title: Interactive Dictionary
Description:
This project is a Python-based interactive dictionary that provides the meaning of words. It reads data from a JSON file (data.json) and can handle various input scenarios, including:

Case-insensitive word matching (e.g., USA, nato, etc.).
Suggesting the closest match for misspelled words using the difflib library.
User interaction to confirm the correct word if a close match is found.
The program provides a user-friendly experience by checking for common input variations and handling them gracefully. If the word is found in the dictionary, the corresponding meaning is returned. If not, the program suggests the closest match and asks for confirmation.

Key Features:
Case Handling: Automatically handles lowercase, uppercase, and title case inputs.
Close Match Suggestions: Suggests the closest word if an exact match is not found.
Interactive Confirmation: Prompts the user to confirm the closest match suggestion.
JSON-based Dictionary: Uses a JSON file to store the dictionary data.
Usage:
Run the program and input a word. If the word exists in the dictionary, it will print the definition(s). If the word doesn't exist, it will suggest the closest match, prompting you to confirm the suggestion.

How to Run:
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Prepare a data.json file containing your dictionary data in the same directory as the script.
Run the Python script using:

python INTERACTIVE_DICTIONARY.py

Feel free to contribute or extend this project by adding more features, improving the dictionary, or refining the matching algorithm!
