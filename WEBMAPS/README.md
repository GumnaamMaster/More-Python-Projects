Interactive Map Visualization
This project uses Python's folium and pandas libraries to create an interactive map visualization. The map displays volcano locations with different colors based on elevation and overlays population data from a GeoJSON file.

Features
Volcano Visualization: Displays volcanoes on a map with markers colored based on their elevation.
Population Overlay: Shows global population data with color-coded regions based on population density.
Interactive Map: Users can interact with the map and view details through popups.
Requirements
Python 3.x
folium library
pandas library
You can install the required libraries using pip:

pip install folium pandas

Data Files
Volcanoes_USA.txt: A CSV file containing volcano data with columns for latitude (LAT), longitude (LON), and elevation (ELEV).

world.json: A GeoJSON file containing global population data.

How It Works
Load Data:

The script reads volcano data from Volcanoes_USA.txt and population data from world.json.
Create Map:

Initializes a Folium map centered on the specified coordinates with a zoom level of 6.
Add Volcano Markers:

For each volcano, a CircleMarker is added to the map. The color of the marker is determined by the volcano's elevation:
Green for elevations below 1000 meters
Orange for elevations between 1000 and 3000 meters
Red for elevations above 3000 meters
Add Population Layer:

The map includes a layer showing population density using color-coding:
Green for regions with populations under 10 million
Orange for regions with populations between 10 and 20 million
Red for regions with populations above 20 million
Save Map:

The interactive map is saved as map1.html.
Usage
Prepare Data Files:

Ensure Volcanoes_USA.txt and world.json are in the same directory as the script.
Run the Script:

Execute the Python script to generate the interactive map.

python WEBMAP.py

View the Map:

Open map1.html in a web browser to view the interactive map.
